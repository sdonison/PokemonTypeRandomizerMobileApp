# Overview

This is a Pokemon Type Randomizer. I created a Kotlin command line version of this program previously and wanted to take what I had created and use it to make a mobile app. Currently, this app only provides lists of Pokemon from Pokemon Black and White, but I plan to add functionality for other Pokemon games in the future.

Update: This app can now pull from PokeAPI and generate a list of Pokemon from the selected game region. (i.e. Kanto, Johto, etc.) It takes awhile to load from the API, though, so please be patient while the app generates your list.

I've played through some Pokemon games with only one or two types in the past and my husband and I have even created Type Randomizers in other programming languages. This, however, is the first time I've created one with Kotlin and have been able to put it on my phone. Being able to add functionality for other Pokemon games will increase the versatility of this app and I can continue using it in the future.
